    "description": "This model, which is based on llama1, is designed specifically for non-commercial use and has undergone a thorough training process using an open-source implementation of Microsoft's Orca dataset. The utilized dataset, post rigorous cleaning and deduplication procedures, encompasses 842,610 instructional instances augmented with GPT-4 completions and an additional 2,625,353 instructional instances augmented with GPT-3.5 completions. The unique aspect of this model is its uncensored nature, having been meticulously filtered to remove any instances of alignment and bias. However, it is advised for users to implement their own alignment layer before deploying this model as a service. The model was trained using the comprehensive flan5m (gpt3.5 completions) dataset for 3 epochs and the flan1m (gpt4 completions) dataset for 2.5 epochs, with distinct learning rates set to preemptively avoid overfitting. This extensive training took approximately 600 hours on a setup of 8x H100s.",
